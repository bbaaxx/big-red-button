# Big Red Button:  A Webpack 5 Modern Build Example

### Because I am a big fan of Rube Goldberg

This repository contains a modern Webpack 5 configuration that includes ... well a large
stack that I have been able to wire together to achieve the
important task of displaying a big red button. This button exists only to be
clicked on, but you will have the chance to decide what to do when it happens.

Recently updated with latest stable versions of all dependencies and modern tooling!

## What you get? ##

* A big red button built with custom elements v1.
* Webpack 5 with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
* Modern ES6/ES2017+ via latest Babel 7.
* Comprehensive eslint/flow/prettier setup for code quality.
* Jest 29 for testing with Babel integration.
* SASS/PostCSS/cssnext support out of the box.
* Flow type checking for safer JavaScript.
* Material Design Lite for UI components.
* Workbox for Progressive Web App capabilities.
* All dependencies updated to latest stable versions (2024).

## How to set it up? ##

1. Use a Linux or at least Mac operating systems.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. Then install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
4. Now, clone this repo `$ git clone <this repo>`
5. Go and gently `$ cd <yourself in there>`.
6. Install stuff running `$ yarn`
7. Please use one of these (I use [Atom](https://atom.io/)): `$ vim .`, `$ atom .`, `$ subl .`
8. Run `$ yarn dev` (you can even add `-- --open` for a super lazy combo).
9. Rejoice.
