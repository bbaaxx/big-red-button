# Webpack 2 super bloated starter kit #

## >Because you just have to try everything working together for no relevant reason

This repository contains a webpack2 configuration that includes ... well lots of
things that I have been able to wire together to achieve the task of displaying
a big red button (See dramatic screenshot below). The button can of course be
pressed but you are left with the task to decide what to do when the button is
pressed.

### What you get? ###

* A big red button.
* Webpack2.
* ES6/2017/next/over9k/whatever via Babel.
* Sadistic eslint/flow setup (Yes, you are the masochist).
* Jest for that fucking test ...
* Sugarss/SASS/cssnext suport out of the box ... simultaneously(1).
* Dockerfile that runs flow... a pain in the butt to get to work.
* Material Design Lite.

### How to set it up? ###

- Install git
- Install yarn
- Clone this repo
- `cd` in there
- Install stuff running `yarn`
- Run one of the following: `vim .`, `atom .`, `subl .`, or even `emacs . # I'm guessing here`
- Run `yarn dev`. If you are lazy enough to use this then you may want to know that if you do `yarn dev -- --open` instead, it will open your favorite browser automagically!.
- Rejoice.
