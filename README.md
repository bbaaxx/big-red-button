# Big Red Button:  Webpack 2 super bloated starter kit

### Because sometimes I have to try everything working together for no reason at all

This repository contains a webpack2 configuration that includes ... well a large
stack that I have been able to wire together to achieve the task of displaying
a big red button (See dramatic screen shot below). The button only exists to be
ckicked on, but you will have to decide what to do when that happens.

### What you get? ###

* A big red button.
* Webpack2.
* ES6/2017/next/over9k/whatever via Babel.
* Sadistic eslint/flow setup (Yes, you are the masochist).
* Jest for that fucking test ...
* Sugarss/SASS/cssnext support out of the box ... simultaneously(1).
* Dockerfile that runs flow... a pain in the butt to get it to work.
* Material Design Lite.

### How to set it up? ###

1. Use a Linux or at least Mac operating systems.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. Then install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
4. Now, clone this repo
`$ git clone <this repo>`
5. Go and gently `$ cd <yourself in there>`.
6. Install stuff running `$ yarn`
7. Please use one of these (I wrote this with [Atom](https://atom.io/)):
`$ vim .`, `$ atom .`, `$ subl .`
8. Run `$ yarn dev` (you can also add `-- --open` for super lazy combo).
9. Rejoice.
